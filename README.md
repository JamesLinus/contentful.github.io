# contentful.github.io

At the moment this is just a placeholder for http://contentful.github.io/, ensuring redirection to the main Contentful developer center.

Also, it's a way to have a robots.txt at the top level to ensure specific projects hosted under http://contentful.github.io/ are not crawled for reasons relevant to each specific project.
